## ideas
- something to do with networking, but we still dont know how that works so that might be a problem
- SDL mixer for audio?

### instruments
- every computer will be assigned a random instrument
- press certain keys to play the instrument
- "record" option to save work
- we can sing each note and prerecord that instead of playing actual on-tune notes!!!
- play back previous work

### messenger
- chatroom?? everyone gets a profile / account - login?
- pretty similar to the server/client thing
- extension of the forking server model

### github
we're not doing this. we're too dumb.

### card game
- multiplayer game
- shuffle
- networking with multiple clients

### my_tunez
- extending the project, more audio stuff
- kind of like spotify

### musical chairs
- each computer is assigned a probability
- actual musical chairs / people walk around and try to avoid high probability computers???
